# HTML Layout Learning Project

This repository contains simple HTML layout examples intended for learning and practice.

Project files (relative paths):

- `layout/html_layout_learn/first_page.html` — First example page (basic layout).
- `layout/html_layout_learn/second_page.html` — Second example page (alternative layout).
- `layout/html_layout_learn/third_page.html` — Third example page.
- `layout/html_layout_learn/fourth_page.html` — Fourth example page.

How to view the pages

1. Open any `.html` file from `layout/html_layout_learn` in your web browser (double-click or drag-and-drop).
2. In VS Code, you can use the Live Server extension: right-click a file and choose "Open with Live Server" to see live reload during editing.

Notes and recommendations

- Files are plain HTML; there are no external dependencies. You don't need npm, Python, or other runtimes to view them.
- Make sure files are saved with UTF-8 encoding so Arabic text (if present) displays correctly on GitHub and in browsers.
- If you want each page documented (structure, images, links, CSS/JS used) I can add detailed descriptions per file.

Optional next steps (suggested for GitHub)

- Add a short description at the top of each HTML file so visitors know what to expect.
- Add screenshots (preview images) and link them from this README for quick visual reference.
- Add a `.gitignore` if you plan to add generated files or editor settings.

If you want, I can also:

- translate this README back to Arabic and keep both versions in the repo.
- generate small thumbnails for each page and update this README with previews.
